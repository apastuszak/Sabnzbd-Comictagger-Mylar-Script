Sabnzbd-Comictagger-Mylar-Script
================================

A python script to post-process comics


The cmtaggermylar.py script must be placed in your sabnzbd scripts directory in order to process and tag comics once downloaded by sabnzbd.

The provided ComicRN.py script should replace the one included with the Mylar install, should you also be using Mylar.

You may have to manually set the directory for your comictagger installation by editing the cmtagger.py file on the line appropriate for your OS (though some best guesses are used by default).
